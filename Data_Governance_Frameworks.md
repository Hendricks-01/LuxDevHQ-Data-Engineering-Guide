4. **End-to-End Security**: Secure data throughout its lifecycle
5. **Visibility and Transparency**: Ensure stakeholders can verify privacy practices
6. **Respect for User Privacy**: Keep user interests paramount
7. **Privacy Embedded into Design**: Make privacy a core component

### 5. Data Minimization Principle

Collect and process only necessary data:

**Key Practices:**
- Purpose limitation: Use data only for stated purposes
