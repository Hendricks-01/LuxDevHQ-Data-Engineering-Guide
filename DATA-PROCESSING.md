# DATA PROCESSING

Data processing refers to the collection, transformation, and organization of raw data into a meaningful format for analysis and decision-making. It is a core responsibility in data engineering workflows.

## TYPES OF DATA PROCESSING

Data processing can be broadly categorized into two main types:

1. **Batch Data Processing**
2. **Streaming Data Processing (Real-time Processing)**

## Batch Data Processing

Batch data processing is defined as processing large volumes of data at scheduled intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).

For example, sales figures typically undergo batch processing, allowing businesses to use data visualization features like charts, graphs, and reports to derive value from data. Since a large volume of data is involved, the system will take time to process it. Processing the data in batches saves on computational resources.

### Characteristics

- Data is collected over time and processed in fixed-size chunks.
- Jobs run at predefined times (e.g., end-of-day reports).
- High latency (delay between data collection and processing).
- Efficient for large-scale, non-time-sensitive computations.

### When to Use Batch Processing?

- When doing historical analysis (e.g., monthly sales reports).
- During large-scale ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs.
- Cost-effective for processing massive datasets.
- Perfect for non-real-time applications (e.g., billing systems, payroll processing).

### Examples

- Generating monthly sales reports.
- Data warehouse ETL jobs.

### Advantages

- Efficient for large datasets.
- Lower infrastructure cost (scheduled, not real-time).
- Simpler to debug and manage.

### Disadvantages

- Not real-time (latency).
- Not suitable for time-sensitive data.

### Tools & Technologies

- Apache Hadoop (MapReduce, HDFS).
- Apache Spark (batch mode).
- ETL tools: Apache Airflow.

> You might prefer batch processing over real-time processing when accuracy is more important than speed.

## Streaming Data Processing (Real-time Processing)

Streaming (real-time) processing means processing data as it is generated or received.

### How it Works

Data is ingested continuously and processed immediately (or within milliseconds to seconds). This immediate processing requires low latency and quick response times, making it suitable for applications like monitoring systems and financial trading.

### Examples

- Monitoring stock prices.
- Real-time fraud detection.
- IoT sensor data processing.

### Advantages

- Real-time insights.
- Better for event-driven use cases.
- Immediate action or alert possible.

### Disadvantages

- More complex to implement and maintain.
- Higher cost due to always-on infrastructure.
- Debugging is more difficult.

### Tools & Technologies

- Apache Kafka (event streaming platform).
- Apache Spark Streaming (micro-batch processing).

## Conclusion

- **Use Batch Processing** for large-scale, historical data with no urgency.
- **Use Streaming Processing** for real-time insights and event-driven applications.
