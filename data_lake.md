## What is a Data Lake?

A **data lake** is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at any scale. Unlike traditional databases or data warehouses, data lakes enable you to store data in its native, raw format without requiring a predefined schema.

### Key Definition Points:
- **Centralized storage**: Single location for all organizational data
- **Any scale**: From gigabytes to petabytes
- **Raw format**: Data stored as-is, without preprocessing
- **Schema-on-read**: Structure applied when data is accessed, not when stored
- **Multi-format support**: Handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data

## Why Do You Need a Data Lake?

Organizations implementing modern data architectures, including data lakes, demonstrate measurable advantages in operational efficiency and revenue growth. Research shows that more than half of enterprises have implemented data lakes, with another 22% planning implementation within 36 months.

### Business Value:
- **Faster decision-making**: Advanced analytics across diverse data sources
