# Introduction to Cloud Computing for Data Engineering

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can rent access to computing resources from cloud service providers.

## Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

**On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision computing capabilities automatically without requiring human interaction with service providers.

**Broad Network Access**: Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use across heterogeneous platforms.

**Resource Pooling**: Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned according to demand.

**Rapid Elasticity**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly with demand.

**Measured Service**: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging metering capabilities at appropriate levels of abstraction.

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components while maintaining control over operating systems and applications.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure complexity.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance.

## Cloud Deployment Models

**Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them.

**Private Cloud**: Computing services offered either over the internet or a private internal network to select users instead of the general public.

**Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

**Multi-Cloud**: Uses multiple cloud computing services from different providers to avoid vendor lock-in and increase flexibility.

## Major Cloud Providers

The cloud computing market is dominated by several major providers, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure being the two largest, followed by Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
